# My Day Planner Solution


ðŸ’¡ My Day Planner is my 1st POC around The Agentic Experiences concept!
 
My Day Planner is a solution designed to help you organize your day by examining your day meeting schedule. The solution retrieves information from your calendar and uses the AI Day Planner agent custom engine agent powered by Semantic Kernel and the Copilot Agent Plugins to provide a summary of each meeting along with recommendations on how to prepare for them.
 
## The solution layers:
- SharePoint SPFx webpart for the experience layer.
- Semantic Kernel with CAP custom engine agent for the agentic layer
- GPT-4o mini on Azure AI Foundry & Microsoft Exchange for the AI/Integration layer
